  Magnum is an OpenStack API service developed by the OpenStack Containers Team making
  container orchestration engines such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Apache Mesos
  available as first class resources in OpenStack. Magnum uses Heat to orchestrate an
  OS image which contains Docker and Kubernetes and runs that image in either virtual
  machines or bare metal in a cluster configuration.
