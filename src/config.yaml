      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software
      upgrade.

  cluster-user-trust:

    description: |
      Controls whether to assign a trust to the cluster user or not. You will
      need to set it to True for clusters with volume_driver=cinder or
      registry_enabled=true in the underlying cluster template to work. This is
      a potential security risk since the trust gives instances OpenStack API
      access to the cluster's project. Note that this setting does not affect
      per-cluster trusts assigned to the Magnum service user.

      Certificate Manager plugin. Use barbican in production. Requires barbican
      to be present in your OpenStack deployment. Choices are:
